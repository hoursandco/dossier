When you configure your account we also collect your delivery preferences (send day, minimum discount threshold), content filters (deal categories, deal types, gender, spend tier), and, for subscribers who choose retailer mode, a list of individual retailers you have selected. For paid subscribers, we also collect billing information through our payment processor (Stripe) — Hours & Co., LLC does not directly store credit card numbers.',

    title: 'How We Use Your Information',

We do not sell or rent your personal information. We do use third-party advertising tools (Meta Pixel) that share browsing behavior with Meta (Facebook) for the purpose of measuring ad performance and reaching similar audiences. See Cookies & Analytics below for details and opt-out options.',

    title: 'Security',
    body: 'We use industry-standard encryption (TLS) for data in transit and at rest. Authentication is handled via magic links — no passwords are ever created or stored. Hours & Co., LLC, as the data controller, operates Deal Dossier on infrastructure provided by Supabase (database and auth), Vercel (hosting), Resend (email delivery), and Stripe (billing for paid subscribers). All providers operate enterprise-grade security practices. Your email address is shared with Resend solely for the purpose of delivering sign-in links and your weekly brief.',

    title: 'Cookies & Analytics',
    body: 'We use session cookies required for authentication. We also use Google Analytics to understand aggregate site usage — it sets analytics cookies (such as _ga and _ga_*) that do not identify individual users. Free-tier and anonymous visitors see advertisements delivered by Google AdSense, which uses cookies to personalize ads and measure performance; paid subscribers do not see ads. We also use the Meta Pixel (Facebook), which tracks page visits and site interactions and shares that data with Meta to measure the performance of our advertising and build lookalike audiences. Meta may match this data against your Facebook profile using cookies or device identifiers. You can opt out of Meta\'s use of this data at facebook.com/privacy/policy, opt out of Google personalized advertising at adssettings.google.com, or block third-party cookies in your browser settings.',

Hours & Co., LLC does not sell your personal information.',
